# AiRP: Agent-based Information and Resource Planning powered by LLMs

## Overview
AiRP (Agent-based Information and Resource Planning) is an open-source framework that integrates the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agent-based systems for sophisticated information and resource planning. The framework is designed to create adaptable, efficient, and intelligent agents capable of collaborative problem-solving across various domains.

## Features
- **Modular Agent Framework**: AiRP provides a modular architecture for designing agents with customizable components for perception, planning, communication, and action execution. This allows for flexibility and extensibility in creating agents tailored to specific tasks and environments.

- **LLM Integration**: AiRP leverages the power of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, for natural language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. The framework provides seamless integration with LLMs, enabling agents to process and generate human-like language for effective communication and problem-solving.

- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems**: AiRP supports the development of multi-agent systems where agents can work collaboratively or competitively based on the requirements of the task at hand. Agents can communicate with each other using natural language, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve common goals.

- **Reinforcement Learning with Self-Reflection**: AiRP incorporates a novel reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by the Reflexion approach used in Lumos. This algorithm allows agents to learn and improve their decision-making capabilities through interaction with the environment and self-reflection. Agents generate self-reflective text based on their experiences, which helps them adapt and refine their strategies over time.

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: AiRP provides mechanisms for optimal resource distribution and task allocation among agents. It includes strategies for assigning tasks to agents based on their capabilities and available resources, ensuring efficient utilization of resources within the multi-agent system.

- **Extensible and Scalable**: AiRP is designed to be easily extensible and scalable. It provides interfaces and abstractions that allow integration with various environments, such as robotics simulators, game engines, or real-world systems. The framework can scale to handle large-scale multi-agent systems and complex problem domains.
