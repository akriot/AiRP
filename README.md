# AiRP: Agent-based Information and Resource Planning powered by LLMs

## Overview
AiRP (Agent-based Information and Resource Planning) is an open-source framework that integrates the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agent-based systems for sophisticated information and resource planning. Our goal is to create adaptable, efficient, and intelligent agents capable of collaborative problem-solving across various domains.

## Features
- **Modular Agent Framework**: Design your agents with customizable modules for perception, planning, communication, and action execution.
- **Powered by LLMs**: Utilize state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 for natural language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making.
- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems**: Build systems where agents can work in unison or compete, based on task requirements.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Implement strategies for optimal resource distribution and task allocation among agents.
- **Extensible and Scalable**: Easily extend AiRP to integrate with various environments and scale up as your system grows.
